# IOT1026-Project
This is the Minotaur's labyrinth, in this you can find several dangers, the minotaur is one of them, a pit in which you can fall, a portal to another dimension and finally a gelatinous cube that will chase you throughout the labyrinth trying to catch you.
The object of the game is to take the sword and successfully escape from the maze. 

Â¡Good luck!
